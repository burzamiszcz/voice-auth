# Voice Recognition Using MFCC and Gaussian Mixture Model

This project focuses on voice recognition using the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature extraction technique and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for modeling.

### Description
Voice recognition using MFCC and GMM is a technique that aims to identify and authenticate individuals based on their voice characteristics. The project involves extracting MFCC features from voice samples, training a GMM using these features, and using the trained model to recognize and classify unknown voice inputs.

### Features
* Voice sample collection: Collect voice samples from different individuals to create a diverse dataset.
* Preprocessing: Process the raw audio samples to remove noise and normalize the audio.
* Feature extraction: Extract MFCC features from the preprocessed voice samples.
* Training: Train a GMM using the extracted MFCC features, associating each speaker with a specific model.
* Recognition: Use the trained GMM to recognize and classify unknown voice inputs.
* Evaluation: Measure the performance of the voice recognition system using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
